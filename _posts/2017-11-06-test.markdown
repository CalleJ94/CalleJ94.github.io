* **What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?**  
robots.txt is used to give web robots instructions, in my robots.txt so have I put in:  
  *User-agent:* *  
  *Disallow:* /  
  *User-agent: Googlebot*  
  *Allow:* /  
  This means that all robots is disallow exept for Googlebot, so if Yahoos robot Slurp want to go in to my site, it will first go to robots.txt and see that it don't have access to the site. 

* **What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?**  
  The humans.txt is used to let people know who is behind the website, in my txt file have I put in my name and were im from.

* **How did you implements comments to blog posts**  
  To get comments on my site so did I use Disqus that is a website that let you use their program and code to get comments and on my website so did I put in the code from Disqus in my post.html and that html file let me have comments on all new post I make so I don't have to rewrite the code on all post.

* **What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?**  
  Open graph is a protocol that share information to social media and this is made of meta tags, so in the head I put in meta property for the title, type, url, image for the page, so when someone want to chage it on socialmedia it takes the information from the meta tags I used it for description of the thing you share. On my site I have a facebook share button that let you share the post one facebook and when you click on the share buttom it takes the iformation from the meta tags and use it when you share the post. So to not repeat to did I write my meta tags in the head like this: page.url, page.title and so on. When I write it like this so does I only need to write the metatags once in the head and when you share a post it take the information on the site it is on in that moment.
